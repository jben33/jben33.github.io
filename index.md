# using Markdown language, you can customize the following variables!

# these variables are required -------------------------------
banner_title: Justin K Bennett
banner_subtitle: Mathematics Page
background_image: /images/teach1.jpg

# all of the following variables are optional -----------------
# page_url: /hello only include this variable if you aren't building the page to your primary domain 

# favicon
# favicon: /assets/ico/favicon.ico

# social media
github_username:  jben33 # your github username
linkedin: justinklarkbennett/ # the part after ("https://www.linkedin.com/in/...")
# facebook_username: <-- your facebook username (the part after "https://www.facebook.com/...")
# google_analytics: <-- your google analytics Tracking ID

# By declaring these variables, you can include a button that links to an external website or to media.
about_button: https://github.com/jben33 # the link
# about_button_label: get hello # the label on the button

# optional portfolio section ------------------------------------------

# By declaring these variables, you can include a portfolio showcasing your work and organize your portfolio's items into a custom layout, all without adding any CSS. In addition, you must 1) create an HTML file in the_includes folder for each project with the text you'd like to display, and 2) create a YAML file in the _data folder describing the order in which each project should be shown and categorized. See `/includes/example.html` and `/_data/work.yml` for examples.

portfolio: work # the heading for your portfolio and title of your YAML file
portfolio_description: Please reach out if there are any questions, critiques, or if interested in collaborations. # a description to be desplayed below the heading and above the content

# optional CTA section --------------------------------------------------

# By declaring these variables, you can include a CTA section.
cta: connect # the heading for your CTA section
cta_description: questions, comments, or concerns? please don't hesitate to reach out. # a description to be desplayed below the heading and above the content
cta_button: mailto:jbenklark@gmail.com # a link to an external website or to media
cta_button_label: contact # the label on the button

[//]: # (write a bit about yourself here)
I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Arizona State in 2021 with a BS in mathematics, mentored in data-driven dynamical systems under <a href="https://search.asu.edu/profile/11246">Yang Kuang</a>, <a href="https://search.asu.edu/profile/57462">Eric Kostelich</a> and <a href="https://tarheels.live/applieddynamics/christopher-jones/">Chris K.R.T. Jones</a> (see my 2020 paper on applying data assimilation techniques to forecast metastasized prostate cancer growth). I have an interest in fusing dynamical models with real data using data assimilation for improved predictive modeling (see the 2021 paper with NORCE scientist Geir Evensen and JCSDA/UCAR project scientist <a href="https://www.jcsda.org/christian-sampson">Christian Sampson</a> on ensemble data assimilation of a SEIR-based covid model.) 

I graduated 2023 from Johns Hopkins with a MSE in applied mathematics, mentored by Distinguished Professor <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/ioannis-kevrekidis/">Yannis Kevrekidis</a> in data-driven dynamical systems and model reduction (see master's thesis on center manifold learning). Some other notable collaborators of mine are Dr. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tin-Phan">Tin Phan</a> of Los Alamos' <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/theoretical/theoretical-biology-biophysics/index.php">Theoretical Biology and Biophysics lab</a>, and Dr. <a href="https://emmanuelfleurantin.info">Emmanuel Fleurantin</a> of George Mason University. 

I am incredibly interested in the theory of dynamical systems and high-dimensional geometry. I am also interested in applications to data-driven dynamics, and data science - particularly model reduction, and sparse recovery. Also, I am incredibly competitive - I competed in the USPA as an amateur powerlifter in the 242 lbs class for many years where I was mentored by Arizona elite master lifter <a href="https://www.diehardpeoria.com/">Tim Sparkes</a>. I also enjoy watching the Texas Rangers, so I sometimes incorporate competition/sports into data science projects (see my R work on analyzing MLB player salary trends using a random forest architecture.)
