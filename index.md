# optional portfolio section ------------------------------------------

# By declaring these variables, you can include a portfolio showcasing your work and organize your portfolio's items into a custom layout, all without adding any CSS. In addition, you must 1) create an HTML file in the_includes folder for each project with the text you'd like to display, and 2) create a YAML file in the _data folder describing the order in which each project should be shown and categorized. See `/includes/example.html` and `/_data/work.yml` for examples.

portfolio: work # the heading for your portfolio and title of your YAML file
portfolio_description: Please reach out if there any questions, critiques, or if interested in collaborations. # a description to be desplayed below the heading and above the content

# optional CTA section --------------------------------------------------

# By declaring these variables, you can include a CTA section.
cta: connect # the heading for your CTA section
cta_description: questions, comments, or concerns? please don't hesitate to reach out. # a description to be desplayed below the heading and above the content

[//]: # (write a bit about yourself here)
Howdy! I am firstly a father of two wonderful sons, Jackson and Jason. I played HS football and baseball for Bryan High (Bryan, TX), football for Glendale Community College (Glendale, AZ), and competed in the USPA as an amateur powerlifter in the 242 lbs class for many years where I was mentored by Arizona elite master lifter Tim Sparks. I am incredibly competitive and enjoy watching the Texas Rangers any time I am able (see my R work on analyzing MLB team trends using a random forest architecture.)

At heart, I am a student of dynamical systems. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Arizona State in 2021 with a BS in mathematics, mentored in data-driven dynamical systems under Yang Kuang, Eric Kostelich and UNC's Chris Jones (see my 2020 paper on applying data assimilation techniques to forecast metastasized prostate cancer growth). I graduated 2023 from Johns Hopkins with a MSE in applied mathematics, mentored by Yannis Kevrekidis in data-driven dynamical systems as well (see master's thesis on center manifold learning).
  
As of 2023, I am  a PhD student of mathematics at Texas A&M University. I am incredibly interested in dynamical systems, high-dimensional geometry and approximation theory.
