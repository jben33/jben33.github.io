# optional portfolio section ------------------------------------------

# By declaring these variables, you can include a portfolio showcasing your work and organize your portfolio's items into a custom layout, all without adding any CSS. In addition, you must 1) create an HTML file in the_includes folder for each project with the text you'd like to display, and 2) create a YAML file in the _data folder describing the order in which each project should be shown and categorized. See `/includes/example.html` and `/_data/work.yml` for examples.

portfolio: work # the heading for your portfolio and title of your YAML file
portfolio_description: Please reach out if there are any questions, critiques, or if interested in collaborations. # a description to be desplayed below the heading and above the content

# optional CTA section --------------------------------------------------

# By declaring these variables, you can include a CTA section.
cta: connect # the heading for your CTA section
cta_description: questions, comments, or concerns? please don't hesitate to reach out. # a description to be desplayed below the heading and above the content
cta_button: mailto:jben33@tamu.edu # a link to an external website or to media

[//]: # (write a bit about yourself here)
Howdy! I am firstly a father of two wonderful sons, Jackson and Jason. I played HS football and baseball for Bryan High (Bryan, TX), football for Glendale Community College (Glendale, AZ), intramural soccer for team Optimal Control at Johns Hopkins (Baltimore, MD), and competed in the USPA as an amateur powerlifter in the 242 lbs class for many years where I was mentored by Arizona elite master lifter Tim Sparks. I am incredibly competitive and enjoy watching the Texas Rangers any time I am able (see my R work on analyzing MLB player salary trends using a random forest architecture.)

At heart, I am a student of dynamical systems. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Arizona State in 2021 with a BS in mathematics, mentored in data-driven dynamical systems under Yang Kuang, Eric Kostelich and Chris K.R.T. Jones (see my 2020 paper on applying data assimilation techniques to forecast metastasized prostate cancer growth). I have an interest in fusing dynamic models with data assimilation for improved predictive modeling (see the 2021 paper with NORCE scientist Geir Evensen and JCSDA/UCAR project scientist Christian Sampson on ensemble data assimilation of a SEIR-based covid model.) I graduated 2023 from Johns Hopkins with a MSE in applied mathematics, mentored by Distinguished Professor Yannis Kevrekidis in data-driven dynamical systems and model reduction (see master's thesis on center manifold learning). Some notable collaborators of mine are Dr. Tin Phan of Los Alamos national lab, and Dr. Emmanuel Fleurantin of George Mason University.
  
As of 2023, I am a NSF GRFP awardee and a PhD student of mathematics at Texas A&M University. I am incredibly interested in the theory of dynamical systems and high-dimensional geometry. I am also interested in applications to data-driven dynamics, and data science - particularly model reduction, and sparse recovery.
